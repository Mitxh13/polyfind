# PRD — PolyFind

> Status: draft for team review. Confirm open questions before treating scope as locked.

## Goal
Build a working search application and research prototype that coordinates relational, cache, graph, and vector retrieval while investigating whether freshness-aware adaptive decisions improve relevance, freshness correctness, latency, and resource use.

## Users
- End users searching a product/catalog dataset using filters, natural language, or related entities.
- Project evaluators assessing DBMS concepts, architecture, and experimental methodology.
- Developers/researchers inspecting benchmark results and trade-offs.

## Core features
- Search a seeded catalogue using text queries and structured filters.
- Store authoritative product facts in MySQL with constraints and transactional updates.
- Use Redis for selected cacheable results or query signals, with documented invalidation/version behavior.
- Use Neo4j to represent selected entity/product relationships and retrieve related candidates.
- Use one vector database for semantic retrieval through a replaceable adapter.
- Combine candidates from enabled retrieval paths and rank results using a documented baseline/fusion method.
- Track versions/freshness metadata for derived representations.
- Apply freshness rules to sensitive fields such as price and stock.
- Provide a reproducible benchmark mode and export machine-readable results.
- Present a simple Next.js interface for search and result inspection.
- Document SQL features, data model, architecture, test evidence, and research limitations.

## Out of scope
- Production-scale commercial marketplace or payment processing.
- Live inventory or pricing integrations with third-party retailers.
- Guaranteeing global strong consistency across all stores; the project will define explicit freshness contracts instead.
- Training a new foundation model or claiming a novel embedding model.
- Supporting multiple vector databases simultaneously in the first version; select one and keep the adapter boundary narrow.
- Cloud deployment, paid APIs, or production SSO unless explicitly approved in a later decision.

## Success criteria
- A new developer can start the local app using the README and `.env.example`, with no undocumented secret.
- MySQL schema, constraints, and transactional update tests pass.
- Search supports structured filtering and at least one semantic retrieval path.
- Derived-store version/freshness behavior is observable and covered by automated tests.
- Tests demonstrate that stale cache/index data cannot silently replace authoritative price/stock values.
- The benchmark harness can replay a fixed query/update workload and emit results with configuration metadata.
- Baselines and the proposed policy are compared under the same dataset and workload.
- Report includes search-quality metrics, freshness violations, latency percentiles, resource/work counts, ablations, limitations, and repeatability details.
- No novelty or performance claim is made without direct evidence.

## Open questions
- Which vector database and embedding model/provider will be selected?
- Will authentication be required for the demo, or will it remain a single-user local prototype?
- What is the final dataset and source/license?
- What is the project deadline and expected sprint duration?
- What freshness SLA applies to each field class?
- Which baselines are feasible after the literature audit?
